								<span>I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We now present. Those that can pity, here</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their money out of hope they may believe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Only a show or two, and so agree</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I’ll undertake may see away their shilling</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Richly in two short hours. Only they</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To make that only true we now intend,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Therefore, for goodness’ sake, and as you are known</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The very persons of our noble story</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As they were living; think you see them great,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And follow’d with the general throng and sweat</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, if you can be merry then, I’ll say</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</span>
